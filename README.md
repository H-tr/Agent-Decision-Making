# Maze Solver: Intelligent Agents Assignment 1

## Overview

This project is the first assignment for the SC4003-CE4046-CZ4046-INTELLIGENT AGENTS course. It involves implementing value iteration and policy iteration algorithms to solve a maze environment. The goal is to find the optimal policy and utilities for all non-wall states in the maze.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/H-tr/Agent-Decision-Making.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Agent-Decision-Making
   ```

## Usage

1. Create the python environment
```
conda create -n maze_solver python=3.10 -y
conda activate maze_solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main logic
```
python main.py
```

3. Test
```
python -m unittest tests.test_maze_solver
```
